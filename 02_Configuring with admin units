# Developing a delegation model:

- Define the needed
- Delegate App Admin
- Grant the ability to register applications
- Delegate app owenership
- Develop a security plan
- Secure admin roles
- Establish emergency accounts
- Secure admin roles
- Make privileged elevation temporary

# Delegate app admin

- Remember after completed needed tasks as the Global Admin user it is fine to offload user to a less privileged role to improve security posture and reduce the potential for mistakes.

 - The most priviledged application admins are the app admin role, which grants: 
 
   - the ability to manage all applications in the directory
   - single sign on settings
   - user and group assignments and licensing
   - Application Proxy settings and consent

- The Cloud App Admin which grants all the abilities of the application admin, except it does not grant access to app proxy.
