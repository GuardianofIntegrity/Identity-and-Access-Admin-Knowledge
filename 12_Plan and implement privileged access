# Goal: 

Explore how to use Privileged Idenity Management (PIM) to protect data and resources.

- Learn how to create an access strategy. Then configure and assign PIM roles and resources and manage emergency access accounts.

- Define a privilege access strategy for admin users. 

- configure PIM for Azure roles and resources

- Assign roles

- Manage PIM requests.

- Configure privileged access groups. 

Overall, protects data and resources from getting into the wrong hands. One can also track and manage oversight for what users are doing with their admin privileges. 

## Define a privileged access strategy for admin users

  Key features:
   
    Provides time based and approval based role activation to access resources. This helps to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misued access permissions on resources that are important.

    - Requires approval to activate privileged roles

    - Enforce Azure MFA to activate any roles

    - Use justification to understand why users activiate 

    - Get notifications when privileged roles are activated.

    - Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles

    - Download audit history for internal or external audit. 

    - PIM requires a premium p2 license

Only have one global admin and ideally make the accounts have least privilege. You can assign built in roles or custom roles. 

## Microsoft Entra roles top ten

1. Global admin

2. Security Admin

3. User admin

4. Exchange Admin

5. Sharepoint Admin

6. Intune Admin

## Aduits 

Audits are helpful to track who did what and when. They are organized by groups and you can see by user as well.

Go to groups and then select activity, there will be a Resource aduit section

## Emergency access accounts:

You want at least two emergency accounts, and you want to ensure that one of the, has a differing MFA to prevent lockouts and also one account should be excluded from MFA
